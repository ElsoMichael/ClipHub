## Development

I made ClipHub for my Final Project at IronHack! I am a Passionate Gamer, and I use twitch about all the time! Since starting this bootcamp I just havent had the time to even watch or play games. So I decided the best thing to do was use Twitch Api to pull Clips to find the best Moments I may have missed and to be able to share them.
